# Å½ana's cookbook

When COVID-19 started, everyone started working from home which forced us to cook every day. In order to not eat
the same food on weekly basis, we started exploring different recipes and even different cuisines.
Searching through all our favourite saved recipes in browser's bookmarks soon became annoying, so I decided to build
this app to list all our favourite recipes with adjusted ingredients and amounts in the metric system.

This cookbook contains recipes of different categories: dips, spreads, sauces, soups, stews, pasta, salads, main dishes,
desserts, drinks and snacks.

Recipes are written in English, Spanish or Slovenian language, depending on the source or the person recipe comes from.
I do not plan to translate recipes to all three languages, sorry about that. :)
